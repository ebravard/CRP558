<h1>CRP 558 Final Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>A Look at Conservation Planning in Iowa</h2>
    <h3>Emma Bravard</h3>
  <p>Conservation planning takes on many forms in the Midwest. This project takes a closer look at a specific agricultural watershed located in Iowa and what data goes into planning for the implementation of best management practices. This map shows layers related to conservation practices placed on the landscape.</p>
    <p>In this project, I would like to demonstrate the different layers and options surrounding the topic of conservation planning in the Midwest. Specifically, I will show best management practices suggested by the Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework (ACPF) in the Upper Big Creek Watershed. To do this, several layers will be involved. Data will be acquired from <a href = "https://benson.gis.iastate.edu/ACPF/dwnldACPF.html">ACPF Watershed Database</a>. Layers such as a DEM, land use, and soils will be converted to geoJSON using QGIS. Shapefiles showing watershed boundary, perennial stream reach, and potential best management practices will also be converted in QGIS to geoJSON files. Once the files are all in geoJSON format, I will be using Leaflet to show different base maps and overlay maps. After the Leaflet map is generated, this project will be uploaded to GitHub. Potential challenges that could occur throughout the making of this project include converting all of the layers into geoJSON files, making sure coordinates/coordinate systems are correct, and using Leaflet layers control to accurate display the data.</p>
